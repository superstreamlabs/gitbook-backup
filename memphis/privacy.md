For our engineering team to track and resolve bugs in real-time and our product team to understand which feature is more required or did not build right, Memphis collects **anonymous** metadata **only.**

### Why?

We are constantly exploring and researching how to build the best dev-product we can with value, features, and capabilities built by our users' requests and because we are open-sourced first. It means that we are almost entirely "blind" to understand what our users like or not. **That is the only reason we are collecting anonymous metadata.**
