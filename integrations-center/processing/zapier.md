# Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com) is an online automation tool that connects your apps and services. You can connect two or more apps to automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration.

With Zapier / Memphis integration, you can create automation workflows that will be triggered by records ingested in a Memphis station or produce events from a Zapier "Zap" (Workflow) to a Memphis station for further processing. Great for auditing, notifications, webhooks that might require custom handling, and in-house applications and clients that are not available through Zapier.

#### Capabilities

* Trigger a zap when a new message/record gets ingested into a Memphis station
* Produce a message/record

### Getting Started with Zapier

#### Step 1: Sign up for a free [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/APP/integrations) account

Signing up for a free Zapier account is the essential first step in using and building automation workflows.

#### Step 2:  Create a Zap

A Zap is a workflow that connects your favorite apps to automate tasks and data transfers.

#### Step 3: Integrate Memphis as a trigger or an action

In the third step, you can harness the full potential of Zapier by integrating Memphis.dev with your workflows as either a trigger or an action.
