# Introduction

## The Origin of Challenges

When your application demands a message broker or queue, embarking on this journey will entail:

1. Constructing a dead-letter queue while implementing observability and a retry system.
2. Establishing a scalable infrastructure.
3. Crafting client wrappers for integration.
4. Tagging events for multi-tenancy.
5. Enforcing schemas and handling transformations.
6. Addressing back pressure, whether on the client or queue side.
7. Configuring monitoring and real-time alerts.
8. Developing a cloud-agnostic solution.
9. Aligning configurations between the production and development environments.
10. Devoting weeks and months to mastering the intricacies via archived documentation, ebooks, and courses.
11. Bringing your developers on board.

And the list continues...

## So, What is Memphis.dev?

Memphis.dev is more than a broker. It's a new streaming stack.

Memphis.dev is a highly scalable event streaming and processing engine. Before Memphis came along, handling ingestion and processing of events on a large scale took months to adopt and was a capability reserved for the top 20% of mega-companies. Now, Memphis opens the door for the other 80% to unleash their event and data streaming superpowers quickly, easily, and with great cost-effectiveness.
