### ![:bug:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f41b.png) Fixed bugs

* Stations/producers/consumers might appear without the user who created them.&#x20;
* RAFT-related logs content is being trimmed.&#x20;
* The "Total messages" counter was sometimes wrong on the UI main overview page.
* Node.js SDK - consumers got messages in a broken format.
* Stations with dead-letter messages appeared with a wrong indication of "There are no dead-letter messages"

### ![:pensive:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f614.png) Known issues

* Authentication - Application-type users connect with Memphis (via the SDKs) using a connection token. For now, this token is constant and randomly generated per Memphis deployment.
* While using an older SDK version, an error message appears on the station overview page saying, “Error while getting notified about a poison message: Missing mandatory message headers.”
* When storage capacity reaches 100%, Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive till cleaned up by at least 10%.
* Resending/dropping a great amount of dead-letter messages can significantly take time.
