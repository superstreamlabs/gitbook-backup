## ![:sparkles:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2728.png) Added features

* Tiered storage improvements, including AWS SDK V2, to support broader compatible object storage such as MinIO, Cloud storage, DigitalOcean spaces, and more. \
  Thanks, @[Bastiaan Schaap](https://github.com/bjwschaap), for the fantastic contribution.
* Integration keys encryption.
* Python SDK users can now produce a `dict` object to a station with an enforced protobuf schema.
* Go SDK - prefetch has been added.\
  Prefetching optimization to improve throughput. Before returning a set of records to the user in consume(), the consumer will initiate the next round of fetches in order to pipeline the fetching overhead and message processing. More [here](../../memphis/concepts/consumer.md#prefetching).\
  Thanks, @[Dev Pahuja](https://github.com/devpahuja), for the contribution!
* Performance improvements.
* GUI loading improvements.
* Client libs updates: Node.js SDK (1.0.5) Go SDK (1.0.2) Python SDK (1.0.2) .NET SDK(0.1.1)
