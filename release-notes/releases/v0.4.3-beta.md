### ![:sparkles:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2728.png) Added features

* [DLS](../../dashboard-ui/troubleshooting/dead-letter.md) (dead-letter station) now supports storing messages that violate an attached schema. \
  Stored message types can be controlled via triggers.

* Schemaverse now supports [GraphQL](https://docs.memphis.dev/memphis/memphis/schemaverse-schema-management/formats/graphql).
* Schemaverse users using Go SDK can send [protobuf](../../memphis/schemaverse-schema-management/formats/protobuf.md) messages by sending map\[string]interface{} type, **without storing the schemas locally.**
* [NATS compatibility](../../client-libraries/nats-jetstream.md). Memphis is now compatible with all NATS SDKs.
* REST (HTTP proxy) logs are now exposed in the logs section.
* Cluster configuration. Shape your cluster configuration directly from Memphis GUI.
* Attach schema to a station using the SDKs.
* HTTP proxy. Generate access tokens with a dynamic expiration time.
* Ability to filter system logs by type.

### ![:chart\_with\_upwards\_trend:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4c8.png) Enhancements

* Improved broker memory utilization.
* Improved real-time GUI rendering.
* Broker performance improvements.
* Node.js SDK (0.4.8)
* Go SDK (0.1.8)
* Python SDK (0.2.7)

### ![:bug:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f41b.png) Fixed bugs

* Air-gapped environments - Broken links in the GUI might appear - fixed.
* When sending messages to a deleted station via the HTTP proxy, an error returned “Memphis: no responders available for request” - fixed
* Async produce didn’t work in Python SDK - fixed

### ![:pensive:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f614.png) Known issues

* Authentication - Application-type users connect with Memphis (via the SDKs) using a connection token. For now, this token is constant and randomly generated per Memphis deployment.
* While using an older SDK version, an error message appears on the station overview page saying “Error while getting notified about a poison message: Missing mandatory message headers.”
* When storage capacity reaches 100%, Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive till cleaned up by at least 10%.
* Stations/producers/consumers might appear without the user who created them.
* Resending/dropping a great amount of dead-letter messages can significantly take time.
* RAFT-related logs content is being trimmed.
