### 🐛 Fixed bugs

* Producers/Consumers stay “connected” in the UI in case of broker failure during client connection - fixed

* Stations with retention type “memory” sometimes stuck and appears although they are no longer exist
* Creating a Station/Consumer/Producer with a . character throwing an error
