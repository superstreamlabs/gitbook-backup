### ✨ Added features

* Python SDK!
* "1-click" deployment over DigitalOcean K8S cluster
* Typescript support
* NestJS support
* When opening Memphis UI for the first time, users can create their first management user directly.
* General improvements

### [📈](https://emojipedia.org/chart-increasing/) Enhancements

* Client connections (SDKs) no longer have to send three different ports (data port, TCP port, management port) to connect with Memphis, now all you to do is to send one port, which defaults to 6666
* A new version of Node.js SDK (0.4.0), which includes NestJS support
* A new version of Go SDK (0.1.3)
* Smaller image size

### 🐛 Fixed bugs

* The client TCP connection is now secured and more stable
* Reconnect flow of clients is now stable
* Root user appears twice - fixed
* Factories/Stations appear more than once - fixed
* CLI is having issues getting a list of producers/consumers - fixed

### 😔 Known issues&#x20;

* Authentication - users of type “Application” connect with Memphis (via the SDKs) using a connection-token. For now, this token is constant and randomly generated per Memphis deployment
* For users using an old version of the SDKs, an error message is popped on the station overview page saying “Error while getting notified about a poison message: Missing mandatory message headers”
* Stations with retention type “memory” sometimes stuck and appears although they are no longer exist
* Producers/Consumers stay “connected” in the UI in case of broker failure during client connection
