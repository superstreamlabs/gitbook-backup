### ✨ Added features

* When opening Memphis UI for the first time, users will be able to create their first management user directly
* Client connections (SDKs) no longer have to send 3 different ports (dataPort, tcpPort, managementPort) in order to connect with Memphis, now all you to do is to send 1 port, which defaults to 6666
* Python SDK
* New version of Node.js SDK (0.4.0) which includes NestJS support
* New version of Go SDK (0.1.3)
* General improvements

### 🐛 Fixed bugs

* Client TCP connection is now secured and more stable
* Reconnect flow of clients is now stable
* Root user appears twice - fixed
* Factories/Stations appear more than once - fixed
* CLI having issues getting a list of producers/consumers - fixed

### 😔 Known issues&#x20;

* Authentication - users of type “Application” connect with Memphis (via the SDKs) using a connection-token. For now, this token is constant and randomly generated per Memphis deployment.
* For users using an old version of the SDKs, an error message is popped on the station overview page saying “Error while getting notified about a poison message: Missing mandatory message headers”
* Stations with retention type “memory” sometimes stuck and appears although they are no longer exist
* Producers/Consumers stays “connected” in the UI in case of broker failure during client connection
