# v1.4.3 - latest/stable

## ![:sparkles:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2728.png) Added features

* Messages can be directly dispatched to a dead-letter queue with a specified reason using the `message.deadLetter(reason)` method, or they can be immediately queued for delivery to the consumer group through the `message.nack()` method. These functionalities are incorporated across all software development kits (SDKs), including those for Go, Node.js, .Net, and Python.
* Scaling of connectors is now possible and can be manually controlled via the user interface.
* For enhanced security, connector passwords and secrets are now hidden within the user interface.
* The graph overview now includes representations of connectors.
* Performance enhancements have been implemented for the Redis and Kafka connectors.
* Updates to SDK versions: Node.js SDK is now at version 1.3.2, Go SDK at 1.3.2, Python SDK at 1.3.1, and .Net SDK at 0.7.3.
