# v1.4.3 - latest/stable

## ![:sparkles:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2728.png) Added features

* Messages can be directly dispatched to a dead-letter queue with a specified reason using the `message.deadLetter(reason)` method, or they can be immediately queued for delivery to the consumer group through the `message.nack()` method. These functionalities are incorporated across all software development kits (SDKs), including those for Go, Node.js, .Net, and Python.
* Scaling of connectors is now possible and can be manually controlled via the user interface.
* For enhanced security, connector passwords and secrets are now hidden within the user interface.
* The graph overview now includes representations of connectors.
* Performance enhancements have been implemented for the Redis and Kafka connectors.
* Updates to SDK versions: Node.js SDK is now at version 1.3.2, Go SDK at 1.3.2, Python SDK at 1.3.1, and .Net SDK at 0.7.3.

### ![:bug:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f41b.png) Fixed bugs

* Issue when employing the '`lastMessages`' setting to read new or the last N messages - fixed.
* Slack integration occasionally hits the Slack API's rate limits, leading to missed notifications - fixed.
* The use of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) previously led to complications when working with patterns or specific station names that included dots - fixed.

## ![:pensive:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f614.png) Known issues

* There have been reported issues with older clients facing difficulties while connecting if the user account has restricted access to stations, as defined by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* Authentication using connection tokens for the broker is currently malfunctioning.
* The Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive when storage capacity is fully utilized (100%) and remains so until at least 10% of the storage is freed up.
* Establishing a connection with the broker is noticeably slower when the connection is made through localhost using port forwarding.
