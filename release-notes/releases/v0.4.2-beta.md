### ![:pensive:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f614.png) Known issues

* Authentication - Application-type users connect with Memphis (via the SDKs) using a connection token. For now, this token is constant and randomly generated per Memphis deployment
* Users using an old version of the SDKs - An error message appears on the station overview page saying, “Error while getting notified about a poison message: Missing mandatory message headers”
* When storage usage reaches 100% usage, Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive
* When sending messages to a deleted station via the HTTP proxy, an error returned “Memphis: no responders available for request”
* Air-gapped environment - Some broken links in the GUI might appear
