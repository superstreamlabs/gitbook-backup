## ![:sparkles:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2728.png) Added features

* Storage tiering now supports any S3 V2 protocol-compatible vendor, including GCP Cloud storage, MinIO, Dell ECS, and Digitalocean object storage.
* Client reconnection performance improvements.
* Schemaverse now supports management operations via [code](../../memphis/schemaverse-schema-management/formats/).
* Added the ability to specify Memphis credentials values with helm values.conf file. It will disable random secret creation during deployment.
* Self-managed external K8s secrets with all Memphis credentials can be supplied during helm installation instead of randomly regenerated secrets. In this way, the credentials can be created by the admin prior to the installation and stored as apart of helm deployment.
* Client libs updates: Node.js SDK (1.0.7) Go SDK (1.0.4) Python SDK (1.0.5) .NET SDK(0.2.1)
